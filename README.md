# ConsensusWiki

> A live wiki for contested facts. Instead of hiding disagreement behind a single neutral narrative, it surfaces it.

**Wikithon 2026 submission · AI industry knowledge graph**

Most wikis flatten the web into one voice. ConsensusWiki keeps every source's voice intact and shows you exactly where they agree, where they collide, and where a claim is standing alone. Every claim is cited, every contradiction is rendered side-by-side with an LLM-judged rationale, and every entity has a live knowledge graph that grows as you ingest more sources.

---

## TL;DR for judges

| | |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A real-time, multi-source wiki that highlights disagreement instead of erasing it. |
| **Demo topic** | AI industry news (model releases, funding rumors, benchmark disputes). |
| **How it works** | URL → fetched + normalized → HydraDB indexes + builds a knowledge graph → NVIDIA NIM extracts atomic claims → pairwise contradiction judgement → Postgres derives the structured wiki view. |
| **Why HydraDB earns its keep** | We use `graph_context.query_paths`, `chunk_relations`, sub-tenant isolation, `recency_bias`, and signed webhooks — features RAG-on-vector-DB demos don't have. The knowledge graph is read directly from Hydra; we don't run a separate graph DB. |
| **Routes** | `/` dashboard · `/ingest` paste a URL · `/wiki/[entity]` entity page · `/graph` topic graph · `/query` ask the wiki · `/wiki/q/[slug]` saved query with numbered citations + Connections-Used view. |
| **Stack** | Next.js 16 App Router (RSC + Cache Components), Vercel (Functions + Webhooks), Neon Postgres, HydraDB, NVIDIA NIM (Llama-3.1), Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, cytoscape. |

## The pitch (60 seconds)

Wikipedia gives you a single agreed-upon truth. The web gives you ten contradictory ones. Most AI tools paper over that gap — they pick a narrative or hedge so heavily nothing useful comes out. **ConsensusWiki keeps the disagreement.**

Ingest a TechCrunch article. The pipeline extracts atomic claims, finds every other claim about the same entity, and asks an LLM: *do these agree, contradict, qualify, or stand alone?* The entity page reshapes itself: **Established** (multiple sources align), **Contested** (sources collide, shown side-by-side with rationale), and **Single-source** (one outlier waiting for corroboration). The topic graph grows — red edges mean dispute, green means corroboration, dashed means a source mentioning an entity.

Ask the query box a question. The answer comes back with inline numbered citations and a **Connections Used** sub-graph showing exactly which entities and relations from HydraDB informed it. Click any number, it scrolls to the source.

That's the loop. Everything else is plumbing.

### Layer responsibilities

- **HydraDB** — raw chunks, embeddings, knowledge graph (entity-relation triplets), full recall. Source of truth for chunk excerpts + multi-hop graph paths.
- **NVIDIA NIM** — all LLM work behind `src/lib/llm.ts`: claim extraction, entity canonicalization (with model-family alias generation), pairwise contradiction judgement, entity lede synthesis, query answer synthesis with inline citations.
- **Neon Postgres** — derived application data (sources, entities, aliases, claims, claim_relations, ledes, saved_queries with persisted graph_context). Stable SHA-256 ids make every write idempotent.
- **Vercel** — Functions for the ingest workflow + webhook receiver. Cache Components with `cacheTag`/`cacheLife`. Webhook tunnel via ngrok during the hackathon.

### Why HydraDB carries the demo

Four Hydra features make this app possible:

1. **`graph_context.query_paths` + `chunk_relations`** return knowledge-graph triplets at query time. We pipe these directly into the Connections-Used graph on `/wiki/q/[slug]` — no separate graph database, no manual entity extraction at recall time.
2. **Sub-tenant isolation** (`sub_tenant_id = wikithon-<topic-id>`) gives us per-topic universes for free. Adding a second topic is a one-line change.
3. **`recency_bias: 0.6`** keeps entity pages fresh as new sources arrive without us building any decay logic.
4. **Webhooks** (`indexing.status_changed`) flip our `hydra_status` column the instant a file finishes indexing. No polling cron, no stale UI.

Plus: **chunk-level citations**. When the entity page renders, we call `recallEntityContext(canonicalName)`, map returned chunks back to their source rows, and inline the actual quoted excerpt next to each claim. Real "press → highlight in the source" UX without any extra storage.

## The ingest pipeline in detail

`src/lib/ingest-workflow.ts:runIngestWorkflow`

| Step | What | Failure mode |
|------|------|--------------|
| 1. `fetchAndNormalize` | `fetch()` with realistic Chrome UA + 15s AbortController. Readability extract. Falls back to `r.jina.ai` proxy on 403/429/5xx or network error. | `workflow_status = failed_fetch` |
| 2. `hydraUpload` | Multipart POST `/ingestion/upload_knowledge` with `tenant_id`, `sub_tenant_id`, `app_knowledge[{...}]`. Idempotent via stable `source.id = sha256(topic\|url)`. | `workflow_status = failed_upload` |
| 3. `pollHydraStatus` | 10s ceiling. Hydra failure no longer blocks local pipeline (log + continue). Background webhook will flip `hydra_status` later. | `hydra_status = errored`, workflow proceeds |
| 4. `extractClaimsStep` | NIM JSON-mode prompt → Zod-validated `ClaimExtractionSchema`. Subjectless sentences in the deterministic fallback get the inferred entity prefixed (`"released GPT-5.5..."` → `"GPT-5.5 released..."`). | Falls back to regex-based extractor |
| 5. `canonicalizeEntities` | Batch NIM call returning `{raw, canonicalName, entityType, aliases[]}`. Deterministic GPT-N family-alias generation in the fallback path so `/wiki/gpt-5` resolves to the GPT-5.5 Instant entity without any manual DB row. | Per-entity normalization heuristics |
| 6. `judgeContradictionsStep` | For each new claim, fetch the entity's existing claims, pairwise NIM judgement → `agree \| contradict \| qualify \| unrelated` with rationale + confidence. Internal-fallback rationales are filtered out at render time so users never see "fallback used" copy. | Per-pair failure isolated; one bad pair doesn't kill the step |
| 7. `synthesizeLedesStep` | One NIM call per touched entity, throttled 750ms between calls. Circuit-breaks on first 429 to avoid burning quota across remaining entities. | Per-entity errors swallowed with `console.warn` |
| 8. `invalidateCacheStep` | `revalidateTag('entity:<id>', 'max')`, `revalidateTag('topic:<id>')`, `revalidateTag('graph:<topic>')`, `revalidatePath('/ingest')`. | Best-effort; pages go stale at most until next request |

Throughout: `safeUpdateWorkflowStatus` records `pending → extracting → judging → complete` so the `/ingest` dashboard shows real progress. `safeUpdateHydraStatus` writes the Hydra side independently — the two columns are decoupled.

### Status model

Two orthogonal state machines per source:

```
workflow_status:  pending → extracting → judging → complete
                  └→ failed_fetch / failed_upload
hydra_status:     queued → in_progress → success / errored / unknown
```

Hydra being slow no longer blocks the local pipeline. The UI surfaces both as separate pills with distinct treatments. Stale `pending` sources (>5 min) get a "Force retry" affordance. Webhook updates flip `hydra_status` in real time without page reloads needed.

## Features judges should poke

### `/` — Dashboard
- Hero with **live topic** chip and contradictions count callout in destructive tint.
- **Topic stats** card: entities · claims · sources, plus a dedicated contradictions row counting deduped contradict pairs (no more counting one contradict relation N times).
- **Top 12 entities** ranked by `claimCount + contestedCount × 3`.
- **Recent sources** with the shared `<StatusPill>` (compact dual-pill workflow + hydra).

### `/ingest`
- Paste any URL. Server action fires `runIngestWorkflow` via `next/server` `after()`.
- Real-time workflow timeline: 4 step pills with state-tinted backgrounds, animated `Loader2` spin on pending step.
- **"Force retry"** button shows on stale `pending` rows (>5 min). **"Retry failed step"** on failed rows. Per-row **Hydra re-check** button calls `recheckHydra` server action against `verify_processing`.
- Webhook endpoint at `/api/webhooks/hydra` (HMAC-SHA256 verified, deduped by `X-HydraDB-Delivery-ID`).

### `/wiki/[entity]`
- **Lede callout** with `Sparkles` ribbon and `Synthesized · N sources` meta.
- Three-bucket grouping:
  - **Contested** — side-by-side claim cards from contradicting sources with the LLM rationale.
  - **Established** — claims with ≥2 sources or an `agree` relation.
  - **Single-source** — isolated claims awaiting corroboration.
- Each claim card: stance badge, confidence percentage, **chunk excerpt from Hydra recall** (when indexed), source title (line-clamped, tooltip), publisher chip.
- Related-evidence cards with claim-pair diff + rationale (internal fallback strings filtered).
- Source timeline from `sources.published_at`.

### `/graph`
- Cytoscape concentric layout with node colors by `EntityType` (model=blue, org=purple, person=green, etc.), size by claim count.
- Edge styling: red contradict, green agree, amber qualify, dashed mentions.
- Edges table below: sorted by relation impact (contradict → qualify → agree → mentions). Source-mention edges collapsed behind `<details>` to cut noise.
- Truncated source/target labels with full text on hover.

### `/query`
- Ask anything. Action loads up to 20 candidate sources, hits Hydra `fullRecall` for graph context, asks NIM to write the answer with inline `[N]` markers and `citedSourceIds`.
- Renumbers citations post-hoc so the on-page numbering is always 1..N matching the citation list.

### `/wiki/q/[slug]`
- Inline `<sup>[1]</sup>` anchors → click scrolls to numbered citation.
- **Connections Used** card showing the knowledge-graph triplets Hydra returned for the question.
- Each triplet rendered as `Source → PREDICATE → Target` with the chunk context inline.
- Local-graph fallback: when Hydra returns no triplets (free-tier processing backlog), we synthesize triplets from our Postgres `claim_relations` table so the card always has something to show.

## Differentiators

**vs. ChatGPT / Perplexity** — they synthesize one answer and hide the conflict. We render both sides with rationale. Every claim is traceable to a source by chunk-level excerpt.

**vs. NotebookLM** — single-document focus, no multi-source reconciliation, no graph view, no contradiction surfacing.

**vs. Wikipedia** — single editorial voice + edit wars buried in talk pages. We surface disagreement as first-class UI.

**vs. RAG-over-vector-DB hackathon projects** — we exploit the *graph* features of HydraDB (`graph_context`, `query_paths`, `chunk_relations`), not just embedding search. The Connections-Used view is real graph data, not a synthesized diagram.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd wikithon2026
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in DATABASE_URL, HYDRA_API_KEY, NIM_API_KEY
pnpm db:migrate              # applies 0001..0003 idempotently
pnpm dev                     # http://localhost:3000
```

### Required env

| Var | Source |
|-----|--------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Neon (via Vercel Marketplace or direct) |
| `HYDRA_API_KEY` | HydraDB |
| `HYDRA_TENANT_ID` | HydraDB |
| `HYDRA_BASE_URL` | `https://api.hydradb.com` |
| `NIM_API_KEY` | NVIDIA NIM |
| `NIM_BASE_URL` | `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` |
| `NIM_MODEL` | `meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` |
| `HYDRA_WEBHOOK_ENABLED` | `1` to enable `/api/webhooks/hydra` |
| `HYDRA_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | HMAC signing secret (≥16 chars; generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`) |

### Verification

```bash
pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build
# 40 unit/integration tests, lint clean, build clean

pnpm test:e2e
# 3 Playwright specs pass + 1 skip (query test gates on NIM_API_KEY)
```

### Re-ingesting against fresh Hydra routing

After the sub-tenant-routing fix, re-upload every existing source so chunks land under the right sub-tenant:

```bash
pnpm hydra:reingest                       # all rows
pnpm hydra:reingest <url>                 # just one
```

### Registering the Hydra webhook

Once `HYDRA_WEBHOOK_ENABLED=1` and the app is reachable on a public URL:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.hydradb.com/webhooks/indexing \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYDRA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"url\": \"https://your-app.example.com/api/webhooks/hydra\",
    \"event_types\": [\"indexing.status_changed\"],
    \"signing_secret\": \"$HYDRA_WEBHOOK_SECRET\"
  }"
```

## What's working today

- Full ingest pipeline (fetch → normalize → Hydra upload → poll → claim extract → canonicalize → contradiction judge → lede synthesize → revalidate)
- Stable SHA-256 ids; idempotent inserts
- Three-bucket claim grouping with side-by-side contested cards
- Cytoscape topic graph with type-colored nodes, edge ranking, table fallback
- Inline numeric citations on saved queries with anchor scroll
- Connections Used view backed by Hydra `graph_context` (with Postgres fallback when Hydra has nothing yet)
- Real-time Hydra status via signed webhooks
- Per-row Hydra recheck + workflow retry buttons
- Model-family alias generation
- E2e suite stable against live data (no demo-seed dependency)
- 40 unit/integration tests, lint+build clean

## What we'd ship next

Pulled from the [design spec](docs/specs/2026-05-16-consensuswiki-design.md) and our own backlog:

1. **Vercel Workflow (WDK)** — replace `after()` fire-and-forget with durable step execution + retry semantics + step UI.
2. **PDF uploads** — `normalizePdf` is a stub; wire `pdf-parse` against Vercel Blob.
3. **Vercel Runtime Cache for `fullRecall`** — 5-min TTL keyed by `(query_hash, sub_tenant)` to cut Hydra quota use.
4. **Backfill `claims.chunk_uuid` from recall** — direct chunk anchors per claim instead of best-match by source id.
5. **Lede regen heuristic** — regenerate only when source count grows ≥3 since `source_count_at_gen`.
6. **NIM warm-up ping** in `instrumentation.ts` to prevent cold-start jitter on stage.
7. **OpenRouter wrapper** behind an env flag for multi-LLM fallback.
8. **Publisher bias chip** on cited sources.
9. **RSS poller** for continuous topic ingest.
10. **Admin entity-merge UI** for manual canonicalization fixups.

---

## Demo script (3 minutes)

1. **0:00** Open `/`. "A wiki that shows where sources agree, disagree, and stand alone." 10 sources ingested, ~40 entities, ~50 claim relations including contradicts.
2. **0:20** Click an entity (Anthropic). Show **Lede**, **Contested** card with side-by-side claims and LLM rationale, source excerpts pulled from Hydra recall.
3. **1:00** `/graph`. Cytoscape view. Red contradict edges, green agree edges, dashed mention edges. Pan and zoom.
4. **1:30** `/ingest`. Paste a fresh TechCrunch URL. Watch the timeline progress through the four steps in real time. Workflow finishes in ~5 seconds even before Hydra is done indexing.
5. **2:15** `/query`. Ask "How is Anthropic competing with OpenAI in enterprise?" Click a numbered citation, jump to source. Scroll down to **Connections Used** — the knowledge-graph subgraph showing exactly which entities and relations informed the answer.
6. **2:45** Refresh the original entity page. New claim appears in **Contested**, new red edge in `/graph`.
